However, their definition of 'citizens' was much narrower than ours today.\n\nOver centuries, the meaning has evolved to include broader participation, representative systems, and protection of individual rights—expanding from direct democracy to the complex democratic systems we know today.",

When ancient Greeks first coined this term over 2,500 years ago, they were creating something revolutionary—a system where ordinary people, not kings or nobles, would have political power. But their version of democracy would look very different from what we practice today."

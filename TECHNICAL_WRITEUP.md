# AI Tutor with Gemma 3n: Technical Implementation

**Built for the Google Gemma 3n Hackathon**

---

## Overview

AI Tutor, built for the Google Gemma 3n hackathon, transforms any topic into interactive visual lessons with synchronized audio narration. Using Gemma 3n locally, it generates complete educational experiences offline - ensuring privacy, zero costs, and accessible learning for any subject.

The platform combines text, audio, and visual elements through interactive canvas-based lessons that adapt to different topics and learning styles, making complex subjects accessible through multi-modal content generation.

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Multi-Service Architecture

```
[React Frontend] ←→ [FastAPI Backend] ←→ [MongoDB]
   (Port 3000)         (Port 8000)      (Port 27017)
        |                    |                |
        |                    ↓                |
        |            [Ollama + Gemma3n]       |
        |              (Port 11434)          |
        └──────────────────→ ← ←──────────────┘
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Excalidraw canvas
- **Backend**: FastAPI + async support + automatic API docs
- **Database**: MongoDB + Beanie ODM for flexible lesson storage
- **AI**: Gemma 3n via Ollama for local content generation
- **TTS**: Piper TTS for high-quality offline audio narration
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for easy setup

## 2. Gemma 3n Integration & Technical Solutions

### 2.1 Why Gemma 3n + Ollama?

- **Complete Offline Operation**: Full functionality without internet after setup
- **Zero Ongoing Costs**: No API fees or subscription requirements
- **Privacy Protection**: All data stays on local machine
- **No Rate Limits**: Generate content as fast as hardware allows
- **Lightweight**: Efficient performance on consumer hardware

### 2.2 Core Technical Challenge: Content Formatting

**Problem**: Gemma 3n consistently generated markdown formatting despite explicit instructions, breaking our UI rendering and data processing.

**Solutions Attempted**:
- Explicit anti-markdown prompts
- Various prompt structures
- Format examples in prompts

**Final Solution - Template System**:
1. **Structured Templates**: Predefined lesson templates with specific placeholders
2. **Content Sanitization**: Robust text processing pipeline to clean AI output
3. **Format Validation**: Ensure generated content fits UI constraints

This template-based approach solved formatting issues and ensures consistent, reliable content generation.

## 3. Key Implementation Features

### 3.1 Interactive Lesson Generation

**Smart Structure Adaptation**:
- **Short lessons** (<90s): 4 sections (Objective, Definition, Examples, Recap)
- **Medium lessons** (90-180s): 6 sections (+ Context, Common Mistakes)
- **Full lessons** (180s+): 9 sections (+ Analogy, Step-by-step, Discussion)

**Content Generation Pipeline**:
1. User input (topic + difficulty + duration)
2. Template selection based on parameters
3. Gemma 3n content generation (~2 minutes)
4. Content sanitization and validation
5. Canvas visual element creation
6. TTS audio generation with timing
7. Synchronized lesson delivery

### 3.2 Audio-Visual Synchronization

**Multi-Modal Integration**:
- **Canvas Management**: Excalidraw-based interactive visuals with slide positioning
